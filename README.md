# 911

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/willcodeforfoo/911.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/willcodeforfoo/911)

A suite of tools for trying to make sense of semi-structured crime reporting data in semi-real time. Like from [@ToledoScanner](http://twitter.com/ToledoScanner).

Rudimentary location parsing and geocoding is implemented.

Next maybe a cool visualization on a map or something. Maybe some statistics? A heatmap? I see it updating in real time as things happen.

# 911

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/willcodeforfoo/911.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/willcodeforfoo/911)

A suite of tools for trying to make sense of semi-structured crime reporting data in semi-real time. Like from [@ToledoScanner](http://twitter.com/ToledoScanner)

Rudimentary location parsing is implemented, with a lot of false positives.

The next step is taking some TIGER/Line data and transforming these to latitude and longitudes.

Then maybe a cool visualization on a map or something. Maybe some statistics? A heatmap? I see it updating in real time as things happen.

## TODO

* Proper file organization
* Travis CI
* Geocoding
